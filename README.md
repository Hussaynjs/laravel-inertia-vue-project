# laravel-inertia-vue-project
A multi-vendor listing platform built with Laravel, Vue 3, and Inertia.js â€” enabling vendors to register, list products/services, and manage their storefronts in a single-page application environment.

## About This Project

This is a multi-vendor listing application developed using Laravel (backend), Vue 3 (frontend), and Inertia.js to deliver a modern single-page application (SPA) experience. 

Key features include:
- Vendor registration and authentication
- Product/service listings by vendors
- Dynamic, reactive UI with Vue 3 and Inertia
- Admin panel for managing users and listings
- Role-based access control
- the project demonstrates my skills in full-stack development, API design, and SPA architecture using Laravel and Vue.
